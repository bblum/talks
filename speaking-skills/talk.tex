	\begin{itemize}
		\item On exit, child's thread control block (TCB) is freed
		\item Forking thread does use-after-free
		\item Might return garbage instead of thread-ID
	\end{itemize}

% Say: In 15-410 we teach students to think about thread interleavings and race conditions using these 'tabular' execution traces. But to think about the state space in a way compatible with systematic testing, we'll need to move beyond them...

\begin{frame}{Concurrency Testing Techniques}
	How do we test for concurrency bugs?
	\linegap

	Exercise as many interleavings as possible (given some CPU time budget)
	\linegap

	\textbf{Stress testing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Testing kernel code, repeatedly run userspace programs
		\item Relies on randomly-occurring timer interrupts % say: to cause context switches
		\item Exposes race conditions unreliably
		\item Might not find bugs in any bounded time
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Moving beyond stress testing: Which {\em preemption points} are important?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preemption Points}
	\textbf{Preemption points} (PPs) are program locations where a context switch might expose different behaviour
	\linegap

	For case study, ``thread becomes runnable'' \& ``thread exits'' are relevant.
	\linegap

	Considering PPs, state space of interleavings can be viewed as a tree.
	% Say "Let's see what our example program's state space looks like if we use X, Y, and Z PPs."

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{State Space Estimation}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Uses known branches as heuristic to guess total tree size
			% say: something more lucid :(

		\item Allows user to guess whether completion is feasible

%\begin{frame}{Iterative Context Bounding\related{Musuvathi 07}}
%	Insight: Most bugs can be exposed with very few preemptions.
%	% say: presenting this specific one because it's most similar to
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Explore branches with fewer preemptions first.
%		\item More likely to find bugs sooner, if they exist
%		\item Just as likely to fail to complete too-large state spaces
%	\end{itemize}
%
%	% gr4fix
%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Remaining Challenges}
	State-of-the-art systematic testing can {\em mitigate} exponential explosion.
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item Reduce testing time exponentially by pruning redundant branches
	%	\item Inform users of total expected testing time
	%		% say: so they can manage testing resources
	%		% by only running tests that are more likely to complete
	%\end{itemize}
	%but still cannot:
	%\begin{itemize}
	%	\item Control total testing time to fit in a given time budget
	%	%\item Automatically decide which preemption points are valuable
	%		% haha-never
	%\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	However...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With too many preemption points, it still fails
		\item Which PPs are ``good'' differs for each test case.
		\item Relationship between PPs and testing time is unpredictable.
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Next: Students who could benefit from systematic testing, if only it were automatic.

	% Say: "In the next section I'll talk about my experience working with students who could potentially benefit from systematic testing, which motivates the need for an automated solution to preemption points.

\section{Landslide}

\breakslide{Landslide}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
	Landslide: A systematic testing tool for 15-410 Pebbles projects
	\linegap

	15-410: Operating System Design and Implementation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pebbles: a small UNIX-like kernel specification
		\item Students implement a userspace thread library and a kernel
		\item Both projects done in 2-person teams
		\item Wind River Simics\textsuperscript{TM}, an x86 simulator, aids development/debugging
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Project history
	\begin{itemize}
		%\item Began as 5th-year MS project with Garth Gibson, Jiri Simsa
		\item Tested Pebbles kernels, with user-provided annotations
		\item Recently, fully-automatic instrumentation for thread libraries
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Landslide Design}
	As a Simics module, Landslide intercepts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Every instruction executed
			% say: useful for modeling the kernel/thrlib's behaviour
		\item Every memory address read/written
			% say: useful for checking memory/heap errors
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Navigating the state space
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At each preemption point:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Injects timer interrupts to control thread scheduling
		\end{itemize}
		\item At end of each iteration (i.e., each interleaving pattern):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Uses Simics reverse-execution to rewind machine state
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Experience}
	15-410 student feedback
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recruited students to volunteer near end of kernel project
		\item Provided advice to help annotation, but not to help debug
		\item Majority of groups found previously-unknown races
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Limitations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students spent \textasciitilde{}2 hours annotating kernels
		\item After annotation, 30-60 min configuring preemption points
			% say: ...before finding & analyzing bugs
		\item Selection bias: only students with free time volunteered
	\end{itemize}
	% Say: reducing annotation effort is just engineering, but the need for
	% the tool to automatically infer & insert "good" preemption points
	% motivates my new technique [of iterative deepening].

\begin{frame}{Iterative Deepening Challenges}
	How best to use state space estimates to predict testing time?
		% say: As we saw when I discussed estimation, accuracy improves as state space coverage increases. So there will be a tradeoff...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Estimate quality improves as state space coverage increases
		\item Wait longer each iteration before using estimate: More accurate
		\item Wait less each iteration before using estimate: More time saved
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Which preemption points matter more? % say i.e., which are most likely to find bugs? conversely, which provide most meaningful guarantee if no bug is found?
	% say: relying on human intuition, how can we reproduce that automatically
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use same default set as before (mutex/scheduler operations)
		\item Look for unsafe shared memory accesses to identify new candidates
		%\item Assign heuristic priorities to each class of preemption points
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evaluation}
	Can experienced TAs use systematic testing to grade more accurately?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compare with Fritz, 15-410 stress-testing framework
		\item Run each on several semesters of projects, compare bugs found
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Can students use systematic testing as easily as stress testing?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Offer fully-automatic Landslide during thread library project
		\item Compare quality of student submissions to past semesters
		\item Survey students for time spent debugging, learning the tool, etc.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Limitations / Future Work}
	Individually-long-running tests for resource exhaustion scenarios
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Systematic testing relies on short test case iterations
		\item Some program behaviours only arise, e.g., when \texttt{malloc()} fails
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Reliance on imperfect techniques as building blocks
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State space estimates
			%\begin{itemize}
				%\item Accuracy is often dependent on exploration ordering
			%\end{itemize}
		\item Using shared memory accesses as preemption points
			\begin{itemize}
				\item False positives (benign access pairs) can cause unnecessary work
				\item Especially likely when testing concurrency primitives
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Some reliance on human intuition remains
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Test authors may need annotations to influence preemption points
			% say: Anticipate will need annotations for author of test suite
	\end{itemize}
