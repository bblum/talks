Add to survey:
	question, "What do you think you learned from this?"
	question, "were there any false positive bug reports that waylaid you?"
	field to write andrewids on each printed-out sheet

Add a test case to correspond to the paradise lost example in lecture.

Modify the lecture so that I can pose a question or two to the students.
