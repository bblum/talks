Dear students,

This semester, as part of a collaboration with researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University, we have the opportunity to use a special concurrency testing tool
called Landslide to test your submissions. In contrast to stress testing,
Landslide implements systematic testing, a technique which exercises different
thread interleavings sequentially in an attempt to exhaust the state space of
all possible interleavings. This technique reproduces bugs in a bounded amount
of time, and offers more detailed debugging feedback should bugs be found.

Students who volunteer will have their submitted projects tested by Landslide
in addition to the usual test suite. Concurrency bugs found by Landslide will
not count against your grade. However, if Landslide finds bugs in your code,
we will provide you with the debugging output, with which you may attempt to
diagnose and fix your bug. Although there will be no extra credit for doing
so, you may be alerted to similar bugs in future projects before they come
due.

Students who volunteer will also be asked to complete a brief survey about
whether they found the Landslide debugging report useful (one survey for each
class project tested). If you choose not to receive Landslide debugging
reports of your submissions, it will not negatively affect your standing in
this class or with the university. Your professor will not know which students
agreed to the use of Landslide and which did not.

If you wish to receive bug reports from Landslide, please reply yes to this
email.

Students who are interested to learn more about the research technique may
