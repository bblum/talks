\begin{frame}{Outline}
	\textbf{Theory: Seeing race conditions in a new way}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Case study (example)
		\item The execution tree
		\item Preemption points
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Technique: Systematic testing}
	% Say: A way of enumerating all possible interleavings of a concurrent test case.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requirements
		\item Challenges and feasibility
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Tool: Landslide}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How it works
		\item The user-tool relationship
		\item User study (that's you!)
			% !!! SAY !!! : If you are struggling, this is not for you, etc.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Race Conditions}

% Say: Since I'm no longer a member of course staff, I'm allowed to give away a
% race condition that some of you might have, for the sake of example.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Case Study}
	\begin{center}
	\begin{verbatim}
	    int thread_fork()
	    {
	        thread_t *child = construct_new_thread();
	        add_to_runqueue(child);
	        return child->tid;
	    }
	\end{verbatim}
	\end{center}

%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item On vanish, child's TCB is freed
%		\item Forking thread does use-after-free
%		\item Might return garbage instead of TID
%	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Thread Interleavings (``good'' case)}

\begin{frame}{Testing}
	How can programmers be confident in their code's correctness?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unit tests
		\begin{itemize}
			\item good for basic functionality, bad for concurrency
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stress tests
		\begin{itemize}
			\item state of the art in 15-410
		\end{itemize}
		\item Theorem proving
		\begin{itemize}
			\item heavy burden on the programmers
		\end{itemize}
		\item Releasing to paying customers and worrying about correctness later
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	{\bf Motivation}: Can we do better than stress testing?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Testing Mechanisms}
	\textbf{Stress testing}: \texttt{slaughter cho2} and friends
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Attempting to exercise as many interleavings as practical
		\item Exposes race conditions at random
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ``If a preemption occurs at just the right time\ldots''
		\end{itemize}
		\item Cryptic panic messages or machine reboots
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap
	What if\ldots
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Make educated guesses about when to preempt
		\item Preempt enough times to run {\em every single} interleaving
		\item Tell the story of what {\em actually happened}.
		\item Overlook fewer bugs!
	\end{itemize}
	% Say: At the end of this lecture, I'm going to be looking for some among you...

% Say: Obviously we want to be able to always run the third path. But knowing
% that ahead of time is impossible.
% Say: Okay, now what if we could build a tool that could ``systematically''
% explore this tree, and find the branch with the bug in it? What would such a
% tool need to be able to do?

\section{Systematic Testing}

\breakslide{\Large Systematic Testing}

\begin{frame}{Systematic Testing - The Big Picture}
	\textbf{Goal: Force the system to execute every possible interleaving.}
	% Say: checking for crashes/memory errors/etc in each one.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At end of each branch, rewind system and restart test.
		\item Artificially add preemptions to test different thread interleavings.
		\item Intuitively: Generate many ``tabular execution traces''.
	\end{itemize}
	\pause
	\linegap

	Okay, wait a sec...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How can you possibly execute {\em every possible} interleaving?
		\item How can you know where preempting matters most?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preemption Points}
	\textbf{Preemption points} (PPs) are code location where being preempted may cause different behaviour.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item IOW, somewhere that interesting interleavings can happen around.
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	Systematic tests are {\em parameterized} by the set of PPs.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If there are $n$ PPs and $k$ threads, state space size is $n^k$.
		\item Need to choose the set of PPs very carefully for test to be effective.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Preemption Points}
	What does ``all possible interleavings'' actually mean?

	\linegap
	One extreme: Preempt at every instruction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\em Good news}: Will find every possible race condition.
		\item {\em Bad news}: Runtime of test will be impossibly large.
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	Other extreme: Nothing is a preemption point
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\em Good news}: Test will finish quickly.
		\item {\em Bad news}: Only one execution was checked for bugginess.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item No alternative interleavings explored.
			\item Makes ``no race found'' a weak claim.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	Is there a ``sweet spot''?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preemption Points}
	Sweet spot: Insert a thread switch everywhere it ``might matter''.

	\linegap
	When do we fear being preempted?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Threads becoming runnable (\texttt{fork()}, \texttt{cond\_signal()}, etc.)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Preemptions may cause it to run before we're ready
			\end{itemize}
		\item Synchronization primitives (\texttt{mutex\_lock()}/\texttt{unlock()}, etc.)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If used improperly\ldots
			\end{itemize}
		\item Unprotected shared memory accesses % Say: more on this later.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item May result in data structure corruption
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	%%%% Not anymore! :D
	%Finding the sweet spot is a joint effort between programmer and tool. (More on this later.)
\end{frame}

\subsection{Challenges}

%% TODO -- left off working on slides here.

% TODO TODO 2014: move this slide below the "preemption point" series, to after "controlling scheduling decisions", so it can be a two-parter -- "What are the two parts necessary to navigate a path through the tree?"
\begin{frame}{Execution Tree Exploration}
	Important point: When does a branch end?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All threads run to completion, or
		\item A bug is detected % Say: more on this later.
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap
	{\bf Backtracking}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identify a preemption point to replay differently
		\item Reset machine state and start over
		\item Replay test from the beginning, with different preemptions
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Controlling Scheduling Decisions}
	How do we control which thread runs when?
	\linegap

	In other words, what sources of nondeterminism must we control?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Device interrupts/input
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Disk drivers: when disk reads finish
				\item Ethernet drivers: when packets arrive
			\end{itemize}
		\item To control thread switches in a 410 kernel, vary when clock ticks happen.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% TODO TODO 2014: this slide can be deleted
\begin{frame}{Memory Interposition}
	How do we detect race-induced heap corruption?
	\linegap

	In order to find use-after-free, need to know:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When objects are \texttt{free()}d
		\item When threads access shared memory in the heap
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	Solution: Keep track of all memory events
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All calls to \texttt{malloc}/\texttt{free}
		\item All shared memory reads/writes
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{State Space Explosion}

\begin{frame}{State Space Explosion}
	Serious problem: State spaces grow exponentially
	\begin{itemize}
		\item With $p$ preemption points and $k$ runnable threads, size $p^k$.
		\item Threatens our ability to explore everything.
		\item Fortunately, some sequences result in identical states.
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap

	{\bf Partial Order Reduction} can help.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Intuitively: After exploring each interleaving, identify ``equivalent'' alternatives and skip over them.
		\item Example follows\dots
	\end{itemize}

	My MS thesis project (2011-2012)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{How Landslide Works}

\begin{frame}{Landslide in Simics}
	As a Simics module, Landslide knows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Every instruction the kernel executes
		\item Every memory address the kernel reads/writes
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap
	Artificially causes timer interrupts to control scheduling

	\linegap
	Checkpointing/backtracking via Simics bookmarks (reverse execution)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Anatomy}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{landslide.png}
	\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Identifying Bugs}
	Landslide can {\em definitely discover}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kernel panics % Say: note: the better your asserts are..!
		\item Deadlock
		\item Use-after-free / double-free
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap
	Landslide can {\em reasonably suspect}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Memory leak
		\item Infinite loop (halting problem)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Using Landslide}

\breakslide{\Large Using Landslide}

\begin{frame}{Recruitment}
	% Say: So, this wasn't just a research talk
	This is something you can try!
	\linegap

	Mutual benefit
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Landslide may help you find bugs
		\item You help Ben evaluate his research
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% TODO TODO 2014: move this slide later, to be neighbours with the other words of warning
\begin{frame}{Words of Warning}
	Finding race conditions is hard for humans.

	\linegap
	It is hard for computer programs too.

	\linegap
	Landslide is not an oracle.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Annotating Your Kernel}
	Step 1
	\begin{center}
		{\small
		\begin{tabular}{l}
		\texttt{\hilight{olivegreen}{int}~thread\_fork() \{} \\
	        \texttt{~~~~\hilight{olivegreen}{thread\_t}~*child = construct\_new\_thread();} \\
		\texttt{~~~~\hilight{purple}{tell\_landslide\_forking}();~\hilight{blue}{/* A new thread was created.~*/}} \\
	        \texttt{~~~~add\_to\_runqueue(child);} \\
	        \texttt{~~~~return child->tid;} \\
		\texttt{\}} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{olivegreen}{void}~add\_to\_runqueue(\hilight{olivegreen}{thread\_t}~*t) \{} \\
		\texttt{~~~~\hilight{blue}{/* This thread is now runnable.~*/}} \\
		\texttt{~~~~\hilight{purple}{tell\_landslide\_thread\_on\_rq}(t->tid);} \\
		\texttt{~~~~...} \\
		\texttt{\}} \\
		\end{tabular}
		}
	\end{center}
	Your kernel needs to say when certain events happen, for example:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When do threads become runnable / descheduled?
		\item When does the scheduler switch threads?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Configuring Landslide}
	Step 2
	\begin{center}
		{\small
		\begin{tabular}{l}
		\texttt{\hilight{blue}{\# What test case to run?}} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{black}{TEST\_CASE}=\hilight{olivegreen}{"double\_thread\_fork"}} \\
		\texttt{} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{blue}{\# The names of some important functions~~~~~~~~~~~}} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{black}{TIMER\_WRAPPER}=\hilight{olivegreen}{"timer\_handler\_wrapper"}} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{black}{CONTEXT\_SWITCH}=\hilight{olivegreen}{"ctx\_switch"}} \\
		\texttt{} \\
		\texttt{\hilight{blue}{\# What functions to pay attention to?}} \\
		\texttt{within\_function \hilight{olivegreen}{"thread\_fork"}} \\
		\texttt{within\_function \hilight{olivegreen}{"vanish"}} \\
		\end{tabular}
		}
	\end{center}
	\linegap

	Fill out \texttt{config.landslide} with design details and names of important functions

	% Fill in two implementation-dependent C functions in Landslide ($\le$10 lines)
	% Say: Which depend on your kernel's specific implementation
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Configuring Preemption Points}
	Landslide automatically identifies a minimal set of preemption points.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It might find bugs.
		\item It might overlook more fine-grained interleavings.
	\end{itemize}
	\linegap
	With help from you, it could find more.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Optional annotation: \texttt{tell\_landslide\_preempt()}
		\item Hints to where a context switch should be forced.
		\item Inside every call to \texttt{mutex\_lock}\ldots
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% TODO TODO 2014: hopefully, update this with a tabular format in a semester's time!
\begin{frame}{And Hopefully\dots}
	\begin{center}
