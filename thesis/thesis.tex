\begin{abstract}
Concurrent programming presents a challenge to students and experts alike because of the complexity of multithreaded interactions and the difficulty to reproduce and reason about bugs.
Stateless model checking is a concurrency testing approach which forces a program to interleave its threads in many different ways, checking for bugs each time.
This technique is powerful, in principle capable of finding any nondeterministic bug in finite time,
but suffers from exponential explosion as program size increases.
Checking an exponential number of thread interleavings is not a practical or predictable approach for programmers to find concurrency bugs before their project deadlines.

In this thesis, I develop several new techniques to make stateless model checking more practical for human use.
I have built Landslide, a stateless model checker specializing in undergraduate operating systems class projects.
Landslide extends the traditional model checking algorithm with a new framework for automatically managing
%the exploration of
multiple state spaces according to their estimated completion times,
which I show quickly finds bugs should they exist and also quickly verifies correctness otherwise.
I evaluate Landslide's suitability for inexpert use by presenting the results of many semesters providing it to students in 15-410, CMU's Operating System Design and Implementation class,
and more recently, students in similar classes at the University of Chicago and Berkeley.
%Finally, I will present several new techniques that allow stateless model checking to be practically employed on real-world programs.
%Finally, I will explore broader impact by extending Landslide to test some real-world programs and to be used by students at other universities.
Finally, I extend Landslide with a new concurrency model for hardware transactional memory,
and evaluate several real-world transactional benchmarks to show that stateless model checking can keep up with the developing concurrency demands of real-world programs.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages,
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
